    "\n",
    "This dataset will consider Vinho Verde, a unique product from the Minho (north-west) region of Portugal. Medium in alcohol, is it particularly appreciated due\n",
    "to its freshness (specially in the summer). This wine accounts for 15% of the total Portuguese production, and around 10% is exported, mostly white wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once viewed as a luxury good, nowadays wine is increasingly enjoyed by a wider range of consumers. Portugal is a top ten wine exporting country with 3.17% of the market share in 2005. Exports of its vinho verde wine (from the northwest region) have increased by 36% from 1997 to 2007. To support its growth, the wine industry is investing in new technologies for both wine making and selling processes. Wine certification and quality assessment are key elements within this context. Certification prevents the illegal adulteration of wines (to safeguard human health) and assures quality for the wine market. Quality evaluation is often part of the certification process and can be used to improve wine making (by identifying the most influential factors) and to stratify wines such as premium brands (useful for setting prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "Wine certification is generally assessed by physicochemical and sensory tests. Physicochemical laboratory tests routinely used to characterize wine include determination of density, alcohol or pH values, while sensory tests rely mainly on human experts. It should be stressed that taste is the least understood of the human senses, thus wine classification is a difficult task. Moreover, the relationships between the physicochemical and sensory analysis are complex and still not fully understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advances in information technologies have made it possible to collect, store and process massive, often highly complex datasets. All this data hold valuable information such as trends and patterns, which can be used to improve decision making and optimize chances of success. \n",

The algorithm adds a penalty term (referred to as the L2 regularization) to the linear regression cost function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This approach helps to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients in the model, which in turn can prevent overfitting and is especially helpful where there are many correlated predictor variables in the model.

The L1 regularization term can help to select the important variables, while the L2 regularization term can help to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients.
